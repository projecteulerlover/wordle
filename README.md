# wordle-solver

Plays and badly "solves" [wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) from the CLI.

To play, make and run the executable with a "-play" flag. To interactively sovle, make and run the executable with a "-solve" flag.

This uses some janky CLI coloring macros that doesn't work on many terminals for now, so I recommend the VSCode terminal.
